This is my personal homepage. It appears every time I open a new window. It searches on several places and has links to places I frequent. The color scheme is quite dark because I generally like to open a new window and just leave it there... and I don't like bright colors taking attention away from what I'm actually doing.

Some of the benefits that this page bring is that:

On google search, you always use google.com regardless of your country of origin. You never see "related content" from your twitter people or stuff like that. You are always on safe search off mode.

On google images: The same as google search.


Another interesting thing is the "get" button. With this one you get a clean link to what you are searching to be shared with friends (or enemies, who knows). For instance, just go to google images and search for something. You'll see the address bar is filled with strange queries that don't even affect results. Even worse, if you search again, more queries are ADDED to your original query (not replaced). So after searching for several things, you wanna share that link... it's gonna be huge and "leak" information like your resolution screen unnecessarily.

Also, everything is responsive. That means you can use this page in any resolution, in your iPad, mobile phone. Whatever. Go crazy.


So... fork it, customize it (quite easy to do), use it. Or don't. Lalalalalalal.
